# Polynomial operations

This is a part of my academic (Masters) assignment for the subject Data Structures using Java. The repo consists of following java files:
+ For input, output and operation selection of polynomials.
+ For operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and squaring of polynomials.
+ For making a sparse matrix that stores the coefficient and powers of the polynomial terms.
+ For applying the Min heap to the powers of the polynomials.
